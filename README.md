## 3DGameEngine

This project was created as a learning exercise to understand the workings of a **3D graphics engine**. In its current state, it is *very* slow, and I intend to both optimize it and expand upon it over time. This is in part because **no graphics libraries or rendering engines have been used** as a method of forcing myself to learn it's inner workings. In the end I hope to use this engine to make something that, just maybe, resembles a game.
